# Custom_Shell_Practice
Practicing creating a custom shell in C. Playing around with multiprocessing, creating in-built commands, booting existing programs and implementing history feature with a signal handler.

In builts:
Yell - uppercase a sentence
Exit - show some stats and exit the shell
r x - execute a command from history, x is the number of the command in history

Ctrl+Z - shows history

The shell also shows some process related stats for educational purposes (such as showing pid of the shell, showing pid of children processes and indicating when they end)
